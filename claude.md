## Why This Change?

The original CLAUDE.md was 1291 lines and difficult to navigate. Breaking it into focused files:

- ✅ Easier to find specific information
- ✅ Better for version control (smaller diffs)
- ✅ Clearer separation of concerns
- ✅ Faster to read and reference
- ✅ Simpler to maintain and update
